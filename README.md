# Python coding assignment
Here, I provide a brief explanation for each of the 4 tasks.
Task 1: The goal was to perform data anlysis on a dataset of choice using the Pandas library. 
The read_csv function was used to read in a comma separated file.
The average, minimum and maximum vales of the Pulse variable was computed. The top 5 records of the dataset were also printed.
These results were written into a csv file names output.csv

Task 2: The goal was to practice API integration using Python.
